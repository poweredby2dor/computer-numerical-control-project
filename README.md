This was a semester project during my years at the engineering university.

The main requirement for this project was to make a movable tray with a pen attached to it that can travel on 2 axes. An Arduino Uno controls the step motors for each axle and commands are given through a few buttons connected to the Arduino Board. Also connected to the Arduino board is a LCD screen which displays information regarding the working status of the project.

The code has been designed to let the user select based on a X,Y coordinate sistem, with increments of 1 centimeter where the writing pen should go.
